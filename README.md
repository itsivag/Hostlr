# Hostlr - Hostel Leave Permission Request Web App

Hostlr is a simple and user-friendly web application built with React that allows hostel residents to request permission to leave the hostel premises. This application serves as a convenient platform for hostelers to submit leave requests to the hostel warden and track the status of their requests, all from the comfort of their web browsers. Hostlr is a frontend-only application, making it easy to integrate with existing systems or deploy independently.

## Features

- **Leave Request Status Tracking:** Users can view the status of their leave requests, whether they are pending, approved, or rejected.

- **Notification System:** Hostlr sends notifications to users when their leave requests are approved or rejected, keeping them informed about the status of their requests.
